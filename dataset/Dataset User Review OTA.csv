"Pros: Cheap rates & good deals Cons: Customer service is almost nonexistent Although it's really my fault for not checking thoroughly b4 booking, it wouldn't hurt to be a bit flexible. I called both the CS. Hotel staff said they couldn't do anything as booking was made via 3rd party. Traveloka was not helpful at all, told me to take the booking as the ""original"". When i have already mentioned that I'm not in the country. All u had to do was to send an email cfm to the hotel to assist in resch.",2,com.traveloka.android,0
App works. but I get 10 notifications a day. Turning off all in app notifications does nothing. If you turn off app notifications from your phone than you won't get important notifications. please fix this,2,com.traveloka.android,0
"I think traveloka should change to another app, because if you're booking or paying for a hotel with cc, it's just a book. When i check-in the room must be paid on site, because on traveloka pay with cc, just for book not pay hotel room and cc will be refunded after you pay in onsite but refund we must wait for 14 weekdays. It's very confusing for me and annoying. Please, Traveloka check again your business process.",2,com.traveloka.android,0
"This was my favorite travel agent. But now, customer service is nonexistent. You can only chat with a bot, and if it cannot answer your question, well, too bad. You'll be waiting in the chat box for nothing until the system kicks you out for no response. So only order things here that you have 100% certainty. Anything else, ordering through the actual hotel or airline is probably a better route as you will end up dealing with them anyway for issues.",2,com.traveloka.android,0

We bought extra baggage along with our tickets but it's not registered when we checked in. we waited 2 hours for customer service with no response. we ended up buying extra on the check in.,2,com.traveloka.android,0
"Recently experienced bad after-sales support from Traveloka. Because of some error in the Traveloka system, it ended up in a double booking and payment for the same fight. After hours of talking, and emailing CS, they have no solution and end it all with the same answer: ""because of the regulations of the airlines there will be no refunds"", but even for a double booking? Yes as they said. So I need to do my own research and contact the airlines to make a refund for it. No support at all.",2,com.traveloka.android,0
"Actually I like Traveloka, the best application for booking hotels, flights, trains etc. But, in the last 4 months this application has an error in my android mobile, while opening the application to book a hotel or flight suddenly the application stops working and returns to the home page with remarks ""sorry something went wrong with the application..bla bla bla "".

"on latest version. lately often showing ""price has been updated"" on checkout. i understand price changes from airlines. but if it happens to most flights and the said new price aren't updated after re-searching (after a few hours), this irritates, becomes a trap, less usable, and makes me switch to another reliable/trustable app to search and book flights.",2,com.traveloka.android,0
"Before, it used to show the lowest price of the round trip ticket already. All you have to do is to search each month and check the lowest price. But after the recent update, some of the lowest prices shown per month are different when you actually continue to look for the flight that has the lowest rate per day. I used to rely on this for promo flights but now it's not that reliable. Sometimes it only shows the price of the one way ticket even if you are looking for round trip tickets.",2,com.traveloka.android,0
"I really didn't have any good customer service experience in Traveloka. While they are courteous in their reply, they are SLOW to respond in customer's inquiries.

"I never want to review an app, but I rely on this app to book 6 flights incl int/nat overnight. For me, the downsides are Too much unattractive and unuseful promotion which just fills up the screen. Not too serious apps for travel and tickets, as how would you combine gold in the travel apps?? Huge spread too And there are free points pop up always annoying you when you're on the page. Geez... But, the upside is refund and exchange travel dates made easy for us, and saved items are very helpful.",2,com.traveloka.android,0
"Most of the experiences using this app were good, except today when I realized that not all promos advertised in the app are valid. I contacted CS via call & email, initially the responses were asking if I used the correct credit card, if the application was updated, etc. Later on they said the promo is no longer valid, when actually it's still written valid based on the date written on the promo page. When I asked further, they said Traveloka had the right to change/cancel the promo without prior notice. great",2,com.traveloka.android,0
"I book flights for certain prices, when I input booking details, the booking was error and than the price changes (more expensive). I do understand that sometimes flights will have price changes from time to time, but booking with Traveloka has been like this for too many times. Really wasting time need to input booking details and confirm price again and again.",2,com.traveloka.android,0
"The application itself is excellent. I just hate that the application cannot be deactivated (installed but put to sleep until we reopen it). With other applications, I can force close them to deactivate them. But this traveloka application?

Had a bit of trouble at the airport because the app said travel tax was included but apparently it wasn't. Also wasn't able to check in at the airport through the kiosk because the name of the app booked didn't match the airline record. Basically more hassle than convenience. So not for me.,2,com.traveloka.android,0
"Traveloka is great when things go well. When things have to change the app and phone call center all fail. In my case the airline canceled an international flight after check-in.

Really superb customer service!",2,com.traveloka.android,0
"Horrendous ads in the opening of the app are very annoying. Yes you can set the push notification, but it's just unbearable and intrusive. Chances are if you are a foreigner like myself who will pay with a credit card issued by the country you are from, you will be frustrated, because the app will request the OTP code sent to the phone number of the country where you have your credit card.

It's so annoying and I'm honestly debating whether to uninstall this app entirely or not.",2,com.traveloka.android,0
"Refund service is very very slow. More than 1 month, my refund status is only ""Submitted"". It hasn't been delivered to the airlines. The reason is ""waiting for other nearest flight"". There is no progress at all until now. It is useless to ask the customer service because their reasons are always the same. Another application is better..",2,com.traveloka.android,0

"I would normally give it 5, because I often use the app with no problems, but please review the properties managed by travelio advertised in the traveloka app. We booked such properties. Travelio agents contacted us, asked us to download their app & create an account there, and generally made it a nightmare to check in. Traveloka is already a 3rd-party app, why would there be a 4th-party app? This is literally the opposite of seamless user experience.

Very bad service using this apps. If you bought some additional cost like baggage or chair then you reschedule it. That cost will burnt and not include in your new ticket.

I would like to give 5 stars for Customer Care services, they respond quickly when I sent them an email reported that I haven't received the e-ticket then they sent it immediately. I also requested to have an itinerary and receipt doc in English and they made a new one and re-attached the English version eventhough the default of this app is in Bahasa Indonesia. That was really helpful :)",5,com.tiket.gits,1
"Fell in love with this app the first time I downloaded it! Two thumbs up to the developers!!! After you make payment, they ALWAYS CONFIRM that the booking is being processed. So you won't feel worried that the e-tickets won't be issued. Some ideas for improvement: 1) A 'FAVORITE' list for hotels, so it's easier to choose hotels stayed in the past. 2) Option to edit SAVED CREDIT CARDS (I can't seem to find it anywhere) 3) Option to DELETE BOOKING, to make your booking history less cluttered.",5,com.tiket.gits,1
