"Pros: Cheap rates & good deals Cons: Customer service is almost nonexistent Although it's really my fault for not checking thoroughly b4 booking, it wouldn't hurt to be a bit flexible. I called both the CS. Hotel staff said they couldn't do anything as booking was made via 3rd party. Traveloka was not helpful at all, told me to take the booking as the ""original"". When i have already mentioned that I'm not in the country. All u had to do was to send an email cfm to the hotel to assist in resch.",0,unhappy
App works. but I get 10 notifications a day. Turning off all in app notifications does nothing. If you turn off app notifications from your phone than you won't get important notifications. please fix this,0,unhappy
"I think traveloka should change to another app, because if you're booking or paying for a hotel with cc, it's just a book. When i check-in the room must be paid on site, because on traveloka pay with cc, just for book not pay hotel room and cc will be refunded after you pay in onsite but refund we must wait for 14 weekdays. It's very confusing for me and annoying. Please, Traveloka check again your business process.",0,unhappy
"This was my favorite travel agent. But now, customer service is nonexistent. You can only chat with a bot, and if it cannot answer your question, well, too bad. You'll be waiting in the chat box for nothing until the system kicks you out for no response. So only order things here that you have 100% certainty. Anything else, ordering through the actual hotel or airline is probably a better route as you will end up dealing with them anyway for issues.",0,unhappy
"doesn't accept a lot of american carriers and horrible customer service, but the app is fine",0,unhappy
We bought extra baggage along with our tickets but it's not registered when we checked in. we waited 2 hours for customer service with no response. we ended up buying extra on the check in.,0,unhappy
"Recently experienced bad after-sales support from Traveloka. Because of some error in the Traveloka system, it ended up in a double booking and payment for the same fight. After hours of talking, and emailing CS, they have no solution and end it all with the same answer: ""because of the regulations of the airlines there will be no refunds"", but even for a double booking? Yes as they said. So I need to do my own research and contact the airlines to make a refund for it. No support at all.",0,unhappy
"Actually I like Traveloka, the best application for booking hotels, flights, trains etc. But, in the last 4 months this application has an error in my android mobile, while opening the application to book a hotel or flight suddenly the application stops working and returns to the home page with remarks ""sorry something went wrong with the application..bla bla bla "". Always like this. Now, I can only open this application but my laptop, too bad.",0,unhappy
"on latest version. lately often showing ""price has been updated"" on checkout. i understand price changes from airlines. but if it happens to most flights and the said new price aren't updated after re-searching (after a few hours), this irritates, becomes a trap, less usable, and makes me switch to another reliable/trustable app to search and book flights.",0,unhappy
"Before, it used to show the lowest price of the round trip ticket already. All you have to do is to search each month and check the lowest price. But after the recent update, some of the lowest prices shown per month are different when you actually continue to look for the flight that has the lowest rate per day. I used to rely on this for promo flights but now it's not that reliable. Sometimes it only shows the price of the one way ticket even if you are looking for round trip tickets.",0,unhappy
"I really didn't have any good customer service experience in Traveloka. While they are courteous in their reply, they are SLOW to respond in customer's inquiries. Some deals are also better in other apps so I can't recommend the deals they have here. I probably won't use this app again if nothing changes.",0,unhappy
"I never want to review an app, but I rely on this app to book 6 flights incl int/nat overnight. For me, the downsides are Too much unattractive and unuseful promotion which just fills up the screen. Not too serious apps for travel and tickets, as how would you combine gold in the travel apps?? Huge spread too And there are free points pop up always annoying you when you're on the page. Geez... But, the upside is refund and exchange travel dates made easy for us, and saved items are very helpful.",0,unhappy
"Most of the experiences using this app were good, except today when I realized that not all promos advertised in the app are valid. I contacted CS via call & email, initially the responses were asking if I used the correct credit card, if the application was updated, etc. Later on they said the promo is no longer valid, when actually it's still written valid based on the date written on the promo page. When I asked further, they said Traveloka had the right to change/cancel the promo without prior notice. great",0,unhappy
"I book flights for certain prices, when I input booking details, the booking was error and than the price changes (more expensive). I do understand that sometimes flights will have price changes from time to time, but booking with Traveloka has been like this for too many times. Really wasting time need to input booking details and confirm price again and again.",0,unhappy
"The application itself is excellent. I just hate that the application cannot be deactivated (installed but put to sleep until we reopen it). With other applications, I can force close them to deactivate them. But this traveloka application? It's so stubborn that every time I force it close, it will become active again by itself.",0,unhappy
Had a bit of trouble at the airport because the app said travel tax was included but apparently it wasn't. Also wasn't able to check in at the airport through the kiosk because the name of the app booked didn't match the airline record. Basically more hassle than convenience. So not for me.,0,unhappy
"Traveloka is great when things go well. When things have to change the app and phone call center all fail. In my case the airline canceled an international flight after check-in. Traveloka is not interested in processing a refund, the airline will only work with the agent. I have paid for 2 international tickets and lost all my money. This is basically theft.",0,unhappy
"They try to cheat the price displayed..it shows price 19 per night..than when i click to book the room,suddenly app pop up price just updated to new price which is more expensive.same goes to other hotel and when i tried again, it shows the same thing even on the next day. it's not 'just updated' but they displayed low price to make it competitive with other apps but actually it's not.",0,unhappy
"Really poor customer service, been using Traveloka all the time but now I think I might just look at the other options ðŸ˜„ Be cautious with your bookings because they don't check the conditions of each hotel. Edit: I forgot to thank you for your past service, thank you!",0,unhappy
The latest version freeze a lot e.g. if I check photos from 3-4 hotels than the app freezes and is forced closed. So I have to start all over again. Very annoying. Unlike the previous version that runs smoothly,0,unhappy
"First time and the last to use this app! After booking a car rental, it mentioned ""the driver will contact you at least 3 hrs before departure time."" Guess what, I have no calls at all, not even a message from the driver!! I paid for it already and no refunds! I texted the rental company but the answer is too late. Really superb customer service!",0,unhappy
"Horrendous ads in the opening of the app are very annoying. Yes you can set the push notification, but it's just unbearable and intrusive. Chances are if you are a foreigner like myself who will pay with a credit card issued by the country you are from, you will be frustrated, because the app will request the OTP code sent to the phone number of the country where you have your credit card. What if the number is not internationally roaming?",0,unhappy
"Somehow the interface sucks. When I want to add my redemption coupon in my purchase. I have to navigate all the way back to the home screen to search for the coupon, copy and than paste it on my transaction screen.",0,unhappy
"From an app perspective, this app is quite good which we can easily compare prices between airlines. But be careful when you do refund the ticket which purchased from this app, and recheck again the amount you received from them. I did refund and during the process it shows I should get 400 thousand something, but indeed I only get 200 thousand something in my account. After i recheck my account and find out it does not match and complain to the CS than get back the rest without explanation :(",0,unhappy
"I hate how this app keeps giving me push notifications of promos such as 'transportation for airports' etc Like, NO, if I want transportation etc than I will book for it. I DON'T WANT PROMOS. This is especially awful because I have turned off ALL push notifications from this app, YET I still get those push notifications. Please fix this. It's so annoying and I'm honestly debating whether to uninstall this app entirely or not.",0,unhappy
"Refund service is very very slow. More than 1 month, my refund status is only ""Submitted"". It hasn't been delivered to the airlines. The reason is ""waiting for other nearest flight"". There is no progress at all until now. It is useless to ask the customer service because their reasons are always the same. Another application is better..",0,unhappy
"The app is very slow recently, even when my internet is good. The service is also not good. 2 times I booked for more luggage, and there was a confirmation. However, when I went to the airport, the check-in counter said I did not have extra luggage.",0,unhappy
"I would normally give it 5, because I often use the app with no problems, but please review the properties managed by travelio advertised in the traveloka app. We booked such properties. Travelio agents contacted us, asked us to download their app & create an account there, and generally made it a nightmare to check in. Traveloka is already a 3rd-party app, why would there be a 4th-party app? This is literally the opposite of seamless user experience. Traveloka, you should not allow this to happen.",0,unhappy
"for traveloka eats specifically, i just don't get why when i searched for a tenant i got the one so far away from my current location? i accidentally ordered from that specific tenant a few times and it bugs me on how inconvenient this is. is it possible to change the algorithm to make sure the search results are dependent on my current location?",0,unhappy
"Too noisy - too much unnecessary info and advertising - several features are unseen, because of the placement, or the component using list instead of CTA/Chip/etc which will be easy to scan rather than list (especially on flights book) - not clear instruction - not flexible payment options - many hidden info and hidden features",0,unhappy
"I was booked for car rental in Bandung. At the traveloka website, it mentions the terms that the car renter only provides an id card and driver license. A week after my booking, the car rental company sent me a message by whatsapp and asked to send them a photo of my credit card. After several phone calls with Traveloka, they just followed the request of the car rental co. that not mention in traveloka terms. IT'S A SILLY!!! I must cancel my booking. Never rent a car from Traveloka!",0,unhappy
The available promotions aren't automatically activated. Disappointed.,0,unhappy
I recommend you customers to verify the promo offers on the app with the related hotel before actually booking and finishing payment.,0,unhappy
"Bad after sale service. Recently, i bought a ticket. After payment, it notices me the diff route.. i have to cancel that ticket and that cost me around IDR 1.2m. So i purchased another ticket, the app showed me another route (again). I contact the help center and get no solution. I'm back to my purchase and it shows me that i purchased the right route.. this app and the company is not good anymore.. I demand an improvement.. i'll move to another app.. until the company fixes this ..",0,unhappy
"Your system error, but we customer that did need to take the responsibility (?)(?)(?)(?) I did a reschedule for 4 tickets including myself, but just me that didn't get the reschedule, I call the CS but they told me that It's already past the departure time so you can't reschedule or refund, but the other 3 tickets that I reschedule had no problems like that.",0,unhappy
"every time I fill out my details for booking, it always goes back to the main page and says something went wrong. it happened 3 times already with me using strong wifi connection. annoying.",0,unhappy
"The apps themselves are good. I just had a bad experience with the company's service, that doesn't really care much about the customer. For companies as big as traveloka, they should put customer satisfaction in front, hell, they're a service based company. I rather from now on pay more to local travel, who pays more attention to our needs and hear our complaints wholeheartedly rather than inject money for this big ignorant corporate. Shame. You just lost one loyal customer!",0,unhappy
"The Sum of it all in one word : ""Terrible"" Always shows : x rooms available, but when click to select the desired room always returns ""no room(s) available"" and that ""x room(s) available"" stays, no matter how many times refreshing the hotel list.",0,unhappy
"This app is the poorest app that I've ever used than the others (tokopedia, bibli, shopee, or etc). Don't you ever think a child who loves chocolate can be upset if he finds his chocolate becomes more expensive after the cashier says the chocolate isn't cheap or the right way to get the promo? Can you imagine that? I was like that too.. The system doesn't say you can't use bank account for payment method so the result is my new user's promo is gone and I don't have any voucher again",0,unhappy
"is it possible to have air asia on the list? i have a problem with payment on air asia, than traveloka is the best and helpful with every payment method. but, because airasia is not on the list anymore, i have never used traveloka like before i did. even for booking hotels. its trouble some.",0,unhappy
"They give somewhat nice discounts; sometimes better than grab, most times not. Their one-click payment BCA NEVER WORKS!! It always makes it lagged and stuck. And yet its the form of payment they encourage the most.",0,unhappy
"I am sending my queries on how to reschedule my flight for 03.15.20 since last march 11 but a reply to me is always the same where. i said that the reschedule via is app is expired. But as per airasia's new travel advice, i can request for reschedule.. but through your app, i cannot because its expired... since. march 11 i am asking for assistance and updates... i'm not fully aware of other things i can do in this app.. but no one is replying to me.. they replied too late..",0,unhappy
The filter is not good enough for me because it will be nice if you can make more to detail example when I click parking can u make 2 choices of free parking or just chargeable parking and 1 more thing when it came to choosing a room to stay at the hotel not everyone wants the same kind of room example if i need 3 rooms and between this i need 2 rooms for deluxe and 1 room for superior but ur app doesnt allowed that coz this is good to make budget more efficient,0,unhappy
"15/2/2023 This app has always worked wonders for me. But the latest update does not allow me to book flights. It says ""you have made multiple bookings for this flight please continue under booking"". I checked my booking section and nothing. I will put a 5 star again once Traveloka has fixed this",0,unhappy
"Traveloka needs to apply for a refund/reschedule option to all customer made bookings. Sometimes, bad things happen after customers booked the hotel, but we cannot refund or even reschedule the bookings (due to traveloka bookings policy). finally I have to pass my bookings freely to a relative.",0,unhappy
"Can't buy extra luggages via web or calling customer services, can't reschedule for rescheduled flights because the app and website keep crashing. A little less expensive than the official booking site but lacking so many features. Feel like I was scammed, TWICE",0,unhappy
Works fine if you want overpriced tickets. Used to be great. Now domestic Indonesia flights are limited to 2 major players and Traveloka supports those Duopoly. Shame on the company. Also apps are not useful anymore since not really getting the best value for customers.,0,unhappy
Book flights with refund guaranteed packages. But can not be refunded. I paid for the guaranteed refund. Updated: refunds are now in progress. But the process is very tedious. I have to get pass the bot to have issue reach human support. Bot response is not helpful at all on my issue.,0,unhappy
Frequent errors and lots of charges,0,unhappy
"Overall Traveloka itself has always been helpful and easy to use. They just need to choose another e-payment partner instead of UANGKU. It sucks, really.",0,unhappy
Stop giving me worthless millions of notifications everyday. And that is after I disabled push notifications from the app. I also cannot make payments using a foreign credit card. Customer service was not helpful at all in figuring this out.,0,unhappy

At the same time, she gave me no resolution whatsoever.",0,unhappy

"The customer service is frustrating and painful to deal with, and their app contact is extremely slow with responding to customer concerns. They inserted the incorrect name on an airline ticket, and with 1 day until my flight, they still have not solved the issue. So i need to turn up at the airport and hope the airline doesn't refuse me access to my flight. I would not recommend anybody to use this company despite their cheaper pricing. I guess the old adage is true. You get what you pay for.",0,unhappy
"I usually have no problem with my booking. Hassle free. Bought the 100% refund guarantee many times, and the process were always smooth, fast and reliable. But last month bought flight ticket, they said refund will take 90 working days. If it's a small amount won't be a problem. But for amount 14mio rupiah, it's like your money being freezed for 3 months like time deposit saving account, but this one won't get you interest. It's not what one would expect when buying refund guarantee.",0,unhappy
"I have terrible experience with this app. I purchased airplane tickets for me and my family on this app. One day before the departure, after checkin online I could not obtain the boarding pass. It was impossible to reach customer service all my calls to the hotline were directed to automatical box and the chat function only answered to common questions. I do not recommend this application. I hope that my review will save you some time ðŸ™",0,unhappy
"Reserved flights at ~ MYR 298++, before paying, it surged to 320++, eventually ballooning to 440++. Switch to the following day, listed price was again ~MYR 298++. again, during checkout, the amount changed to MYR 326+, then escalated to MYR 529+. This is a clear breach of honesty, as Traveloka failed to honor their initially stated price. We turned to Agoda for the same flight/date, paid and got it at 316+. Documented evidence, intend to report to Consumer Rights agency.",0,unhappy
"I made an account with Traveloka and made my first booking to get their 5% new client discount. At checkout the coupon code didn't work, so I contacted customer service. I had to re-explain the situation twice before they finally sent me an automated answer telling me that the coupon is no longer available. Of course no refund is possible on the purchase I made. Predatory and opaque, avoid at all costs!",0,unhappy
"They intendly make reporting issues really hard. No hotline, just answering AI keep asking unrelated questions. You have to wait for the AI to reply but if it has to wait for 10 minutes or so, the chat will automatically close. There's actually a hotline but it'll send you back to the reporting on the app.",0,unhappy
"Horrible Customer Service. Traveloka has a pretence that they have everything under control. For a digital platform, customer service needs to be excellent. They barely have any such thing sorted. I am in a situation I spoke to the airlines, and they have given me a proof of refund but in TravelokaApp, it still shows that airline has not approved. Just got a message from their BoT that it will take another 90 days for the issue to be cleared. Been loyal user since last 5 years but not anymore",0,unhappy
"Very unreliable. They will not send an e-ticket right away. And it took me 20 hours to get in touch with them, and then they would just say that my purchase failed, when in fact they were able to charge my account. And they debited my bank for a few seconds, and it took 3-5 business days for me to get a refund. The heck!",0,unhappy
"Used this app to book a flight. In the confirmation email, i saw a double entry to my name. Reflected to CS, they asked me to pay $200+. Told them i didn't want to proceed to change the name (as i could do it over the counter, too). When i was about to check in for my flight, i found out from the airline that Traveloka didn't make the booking and didnt communicate my request for a special dietary meal. Will never be using Traveloka again.",0,unhappy
"Being a loyal user for many years, now I realized how bad their customer service is. My mother received a booking confirmation which she did not made. Thus, I call hotline to ask if there is any mistakes but couldn't meet any agents. There is only auto-recorded voice and could not solve my problem. Thus, I contacted the info on booking myself and learnt that the booking info is correct but Traveloka sent to the wrong person, thereby exposing customer personal's info, such insecure for user.",0,unhappy
"Been a loyal user since 2015, but I'm very disappointed in how the CS handles my car rental refund. It's been almost 3 months now since I requested the refund, and while the system says refund was successful, yet I have never received it. CS answers were not satisfying and they kept asking to wait. Clearly this is a company that does not care about the user. I will never again use this app, and urge everyone to do the same.",0,unhappy
"I found a hotel cheaper in Traveloka. The website didn't work, stays loading forever even before confirming the room. I installed the app, and the hotel is way more expensive in the app than in the website. I want to delete my account, but no option to delete ir or to contact support.",0,unhappy
"I am dissapointed with the way Traveloka does the rating for the car rental companies. I can only give a rating on driver performance, car quality & driver punctuality. When in reality a lot of these car rental companies are over priced, have a lot of hidden fees & demands a lot of different kinds of payment. Please Traveloka there are a lot of horrible car rental companies that are very dishonest & shouldn't be in the app",0,unhappy
"I did not receive a full refund due to schedule changes made by the airline Super Air Jet IU 814 on August 9, 2023. The process took more than 14 days from the time I submitted a refund. There's no point in being priority Platinum here, in Traveloka.",0,unhappy

"No alternative solutions, no consideration even they saw the complete info of the passenger they said not double booking,arrrghh so disappointed i always book and use traveloka but this time I will stop using you.

Traveloka payment options are only for show. They have many payment options but they only want you to pay thru credit cards by giving you insufficient time to pay. I have been struggling to pay using coins ph because they are only giving you a very small amount of time and it is very difficult to access coins ph thru their app. Their convenience fee is also very high. I have been using traveloka for very long time now but my experience just now made me decide to write this review.,0,unhappy
"Date didn't shown clearly, confusing and intended for user to make wrong choices of flight date so they can charge you later. Really trap apps. Font for date size were small, font for flight time were small. No warning when you made purchase regarding date and flight time. Too many push ads which took most of the page and hard to close. Better pick another apps rather than this.",0,unhappy
"Overall functions are good. But there is bad UI in the app. Filter view doesn't use Traveloka app font, it uses default smartphone phone font. So, some users see the UI bad.",1,satisfied
The purchase confirmation process was delayed and have to wait in agony for a response from the CS. But eventually they helped to get things settled.,1,satisfied
"Great apps, with slow response customer service support.",1,satisfied
"easy to use, very helpful. but sometimes when I try to find flight schedule the app is crashing & the page won't show the informations. and some airlines aren't not here, I must restart the device to find them. please solve these problems. Thanks in advance.",1,satisfied
"Update: It seems to be working fine now. I'll let you know if it happens again. Thanks for your quick reply! Why am I getting an error message most times I try to search for flights the past 2 days? If I go back and redo it later, it sometimes shows the search results. But yesterday it wouldn't work at all for a long time. Today, it's intermittently doing this, even after clearing the cache. It's never done this before...",1,satisfied
"Searching flights and hotels are quick and easy, but hotel selection is not as complete as what other competitor apps provide. Never have a problem with the payment either. Suggestion: the app should provide the flight's airship model. Since the recent Boeing Max8 disaster, passenger could use some information regarding the flight's airship model",1,satisfied
"Been using this app for years, for its easy and seamless flight and hotel bookings. No complaints so far regarding the features. But 1 less star for punishing customers who book rooms on the check-in day. Some of us have emergencies that require us to book a room on the same day of the check-in (not advanced). And you give us a bad score for doing that ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸",1,satisfied
Review page for hotel booking should have more than two option : awesome and unsatisfying. Why not give the choice to give stars out of 5 or a scale of 1-10 maybe? We can't be objective if there's only 2 choice. A lot of hotels are usually somewhere between awesome and unsatisfying.,1,satisfied
The app may have room for improvement. It would be great if i could search for a certain hotel name to see some promo or things like that. Customer service is good. Calling and emails are replied promptly and they do try to help without delays.,1,satisfied
"The tenant can cancel our booking less than 24 hour. But we can't cancel our booking if it's not stated refundable. The refund is in voucher, so we must wait the voucher for another booking if you patient enough or can change your schedule. Greatest way to ruin your holiday plan. Very disappointed and displeased. And after I contacted by traveloka, I cannot contact them again. They just ask me to wait....??? Seems like the refund things is improved. Good.",1,satisfied
"It is a great application, it is well organized and easy to use. It offers most of the things a travel needed. It is convenient for those who want a smooth and hassle-free transactions. One of the best application so far it is detailed when it comes to the tourist destination's history and such but it has some minor issues as well. They don't have coupons but they are generous to give discounts. For recommendations, kindly do something about the cancellations of bookings.",1,satisfied
"This app is just okay. Easy to use, and so far I never have any unpleasant experience. I just rate it â­â­â­â­ because the selection for best deal is not interesting. I do not know, but maybe the company is get tired in competing with their competitors? Or the relationships with hotel, airliners and other travel service providers getting sour?",1,satisfied
"I am very helped by this application, to book hotels, airline tickets and many more. A little advice, can you add an option to ""add to the calendar"" for e-ticket flights, as you do if you send a hotel e-voucher? Because until now every flight, I have to bother to enter flight details manually into my calendar. If the option is entered into the latest update, 5 stars for Traveloka. Keep up-to-date Traveloka team, Thanks",1,satisfied
"I've been using this app for almost 4 years, the ui and ux are neat and happy to use. But I just want to make a suggestion for 21 million from Bandung to Medan, it should not be in the app and the routes are ridiculously long, you should need to make a function that can measure distance between departure and arrival flight, Make sure each of your flight is still make sense in terms of distance and value for money. But anyway it's just suggestion from random person on internet who use your product :).",1,satisfied
"It's a good app with good deals. However, please make special buttons for special meal in flight. I always book for my colleagues as well, and they would like to have special meals, e.g. muslim meal and Vegetarian. Please make update with that. Thanks!",1,satisfied
"I was dissatisfied at the beginning because no one answer phone call, I guess because during this covid 19 situation they are too busy handling refund. I had a non refundable booking that I want to cancel. After contacting the hotel directly, and the hotel agreed to give me the refund, I informed traveloka to help process the refund. And they did. Thank you.",1,satisfied
"Not flexible in payment method, and price always changes.",1,satisfied
love the apps and love the wide range of services provided,1,satisfied
"Convenient, but if i may, i would give suggestion for the train booking app, could you m make into one paper: the receipt with price paid and the buyer's name innit, and also included the passenger info? Would be more convenient to bring one piece of paper if any problems or issues occurred and we need both the receipt and passenger info. Thanks :)",1,satisfied
"Based on my experience with this app, I have been using this for months and it is so organized, hassle free booking. I can always book here using credit/debit. There is no lagging here. Notifications are authentic. I think they don't have Cebu Pacific flight here, only Philippine Airlines I guess???",1,satisfied
"Overall this application is working and easy to use. but need a lot of improvement. my input comes from safety point, in current version (28 may 21). Me as buyer could delete my historical transaction. i recommend that historical transaction can't be deleted whether by traveloka or by user as it's related with money transaction.",1,satisfied
"I like this apps at the beginning. When do transaction, its failed. I ask through email and no reply within 60 minutes as claimed. than i make a call. The customer service let me waiting on the phone for 5 minutes with no answer which definitely charge me more cost sigh update: operator answer me and well managed. thank you!",1,satisfied
"It should enable you to mix local and foreign tickets. My husband is a foreigner, so having to book separately for him means I have to pay twice convenience fee. It's a hassle. Please improve this.",1,satisfied
Easy to use but need to change my requirement several time .please add save featured on it,1,satisfied

"What i love about Traveloka is the way how they treat their customer! There's a lot of promos and the customer service is not bad at all. I once reached their CS team to seek update for my flight reschedule, and they were so very helpful. I hope you can keep it this way or even better and prioritise your customer better than anything.",1,satisfied
So far i've been loving the Traveloka Eats but i have problem with the Eats Delivery. #1 Why if the driver cancelled the order than the entire order is being cancelled? Why not giving option to look for other driver? #2 So far i've been refunded (because of no#1 reason for 2 times. And the #1 refund went well. I'm still waiting to get refunded for the 2nd. The problem is my refund history isn't recorded in the past refund (even for the #1 refund). Keep up the improvement for the team.,1,satisfied

"I need a search bar! When I want to input a specific accommodation, I have to look at it on Google first before finding the rates in Traveloka. There must be a more efficient way!",1,satisfied
"I'm very disappointed with traveloka, why they can't solve my refund problem very easy. In my case the accommodation ask me to refund the my booking because the villa is under maintenance, but the problem is the policy is non-refundable. But i have a proof from the property owner. Poor service. Very disappointed. Very slow response",1,satisfied
Good app. Have complete and various product in travelling. The low budget hotel feature is awesome. But this app consume much storage and not quick enough.,1,satisfied

"I love this app. All in one app. Quick & easy. I sometimes went overseas and it's work well there. For suggestion, I often rides air****, could you please re approach & persuade them for better cooperation.",1,satisfied
"Hopeless. Booked flights on the desktop, but they will not show up on the mobile. Quite useless. But after a few emails it transpired that the country can not be settled to global.",1,satisfied
best travel app so far. there's a lot of option for accommodations and tourist attraction. easy to book and various payment method.,1,satisfied
Quick to find accomodation but search filters are too basic. Need to add pet friendly filter? Easy to book flights too but try to include more airlines so I don't have to switch between apps.,1,satisfied
Actually this app is fascinating but only one thing make me annoying so much is that this app always asking for update. Like in a month I updated it 2-3x and there is nothing specific change after I updated it. Why traveloka needs to update every 2 weeks while there is no change at all in the app??,1,satisfied
it's easy to use and very convenient.. however no menu for pay later payment by credit card / visa available on this application and it's makes uncomfortable to makes more transaction onto it..,1,satisfied
"Everything is good with the app, but could you please add the feature where our booking is automatically added to our calendar? I wonder if it's just me but with A*ry, my bookings are automatically added to my calendars; both google calendar and my phone's calendar. Thank you.",1,satisfied
"UPDATE : Finally, traveloka has transferred my refunds. Thanks a lot for solving my refunds although it was a long process! ðŸ‘ This was before : WORST SERVICE EVER. Due to COVID-19 outbreak, I asked about my flights refund via application because it was hard to do phone call with traveloka customer service. Singapore Airlines informed me that my return flight has been cancelled, but traveloka denied my refund requests 2 times until my ticket money around 5,3 million rupiahs gone for nothing.",1,satisfied
"so far that i love the most is pay later and movies discount. but, to bad when suddenly your pay later limit got downgrade with no reason, when i also as far i remember never late pay my pay later bill.",1,satisfied
"I'm loving this app. But there is one suggestion that I will make. Please allow us customers to be able to add baggage allowance on the application, specifically for the Philippine Airlines. Just that and this application will be outstanding. â˜º",1,satisfied

But the funny thing is when the app asked me for a review to an accomodation, It won't save why?

The ""send"" button become grey and the review can not be send. Funny App.",0,unhappy

"Great, it's best offering",1,satisfied
"Great app! Serve you with a lot of promo code and sometimes the ticket price is cheaper than any other apps. I would like to give 5 stars for Customer Care services, they respond quickly when I sent them an email reported that I haven't received the e-ticket then they sent it immediately. I also requested to have an itinerary and receipt doc in English and they made a new one and re-attached the English version eventhough the default of this app is in Bahasa Indonesia. That was really helpful :)",1,satisfied
"Fell in love with this app the first time I downloaded it! Two thumbs up to the developers!!! After you make payment, they ALWAYS CONFIRM that the booking is being processed. So you won't feel worried that the e-tickets won't be issued. Some ideas for improvement: 1) A 'FAVORITE' list for hotels, so it's easier to choose hotels stayed in the past. 2) Option to edit SAVED CREDIT CARDS (I can't seem to find it anywhere) 3) Option to DELETE BOOKING, to make your booking history less cluttered.",1,satisfied
"Good app for foreign tourists as it allows you to pick drivers / tour guides who speak English. More user-friendly interface especially on booking tab compared to other similar apps. No distracting ads or pop-up message either. Clean cut, no frills; works great for me.",1,satisfied
"MY FAVE TRAVEL APPS Positive 1. I can reedem my point 2. They have cheaper price compare other apps 3. They have fast notification on my whatsaap 4. I never had problem at airport or hotel ,domestic and international 5. They always have promo continously 6. Its easy to use Negative 1. If they have big promo,the system will be error 2.The price in big promo is hoax ,they will mark up the price and makes discount like its cheap,but the fact its actually normal price. Overall i love this apps",1,satisfied
very friendly user application and so many promotions. Like it!,1,satisfied
"app is good but i had bad experience with their services. their customer services are very slow to respond customer, my flight refund proposed from 18 March up to today still no respond. edited: it delayed because too many customer also requesting refund at the same time. Refund proceed and no more problem. Will re-use this app in the near future. thank you (5*)",1,satisfied
"Easy to use, and lots of promo. Good for traveling and such. But maybe you could add a function for synchronizing the departure in the app with calendar on the phone, that would be great.",1,satisfied
"This app is useful and simple as well, u might need some improvement in cust services cos it needs a long time to respond, for example like when i want to make a complaint related to my destination and also the date. However, it's a great app",1,satisfied
"I shall say this app is really really really simple. Simply log in, prepare the names of passengers, prepare your preferred payment method, fill in your discount or promotional voucher, then click PAY.... That's all you need to do. The good thing....Your payment security protected with one time password.",1,satisfied
One of the best UIs for an online travel agent app. Would be cool if blu was added as a payment method considering there's a merge with Blibli and there's blu as a payment method over there.,1,satisfied

"I change score from 1 to 5 star. Its now working on Note 10 at least. ------- This App does not work (25/3/2019 @ 10.45), after installation on Android S9+ it keeps loading with 3 yellow dot for minutes and minutes. Uninstall dan reinstalled still the same. Their technical team should read this.",1,satisfied

Wonderful app with amazing price. The customer support is also super helpful. One time we're facing difficulty and they manage to settle my issue in no time. Tq Tiket... Keep up the good work â˜º,1,satisfied
"So far so good. I have been helped by using this application because it gave not only reducing price but also a voucher gift at the same time. I would be more than happy if this application had already existed since the normal price of flight was still there. Today's price are considerably rocketed due to unknown reason which can weaken our buyability. Hopefully, this application will still offer us an appropriate concession in the future, so it can lighter people's burden relating to economic.",1,satisfied
"Useful app. Easy to use. I used this app to book flight and hotel. The hotel rate was already all in, I put the discount code and saved lots of money.",1,satisfied
"Can I request a feature? How about create an algorithm to detect best travel option I can get, just by providing my destination. The result is combination of transportation I can book to go to my destination.",1,satisfied

I was 100% sure that the nominal and bank account was correct, so it wasn't my fault. I emailed the customer service and they responded quickly, however for the refund I must wait for 5 working days with administration fees. I don't think I will order from this app anymore..",0,unhappy
"The app was working great before it went into flash sale/promo mode. At this point, couldn't even look up any flight info and soon after received notice that the app was fixing glitches or problems in the system. Bandwidth might be an issue? Maybe a good app, just don't expect much for promos.",0,unhappy
"Bad flow in the app, as an app that promote affordable travelling, the shown price appear at the end of the journey right before payment which is no good because aimed or potential customer is price sensitive, thus other major OTA app is better where they show the cheapest price when picking the date. Another thing is PP Hemat, despite promote cheaper price but isn't felt at all, as don't show the cut of price in the price. I give 2 stars as Pegipegi is still better than other amateur OTA app.",0,unhappy

If asked there is always an answer, please pegipegi this as a consideration for cooperation with responsible insurance. Thanks",0,unhappy

"Submission of a refund on March 26, confirmed the return of the refund on May 19. I think that's quite a long time, even though the company definitely says it depends on the company's priorities.

I can't even set the date in this app.. Very slow response even my internet is fast,0,unhappy
"The price displayed does not match what was paid, please refresh the flight ticket price",0,unhappy
The last time I booked via Pegipegi there was still an option to book via ATM. Why is it gone now?? There are only credit cards and i banking bca ?? What about those who only have a debit card???,0,unhappy
"The user interface is actually better when compared to competitors for similar applications. However, I cannot do payment settlement for all the payment methods offered.",0,unhappy
"The application is not equipped with order tracking and there is no user profile management. Error filter feature, there are hotels that are not included in the filter even though they should be included. The price that appears does not include tax etc but is still the cheapest compared to other travel.",0,unhappy
"I've filled in all the data, I'm ready to go to the ATM to pay, but when I click pay, it's an error. After 2 hours of trying, it still doesn't work. What does this mean?",0,unhappy
It often crashes and closes on its own..,0,unhappy
Useful,0,unhappy
"It took me 2 hours 56 minutes for 1 transaction.. Each time I filled in the verification code, it took a long time to load and finally asked to repeat the process from the beginning..it took 10x the new verification code to work..hopefully in the future it will be better..",0,unhappy

The app comes out suddenly if you want to select a date,0,unhappy
"In the ad there is for ordering train tickets, but after downloading there is no such option. And when I look at the website it's also not there. Please confirm",0,unhappy
Ads on TV can look for train tickets too but when downloading it turns out there's no choice,0,unhappy
Always force close when click booking room.. dunno why..,0,unhappy
The last update made it not work on my xperia,0,unhappy
How do I login this?,0,unhappy
"SLOW. He said my signal doesn't work. Even though if you use another flight ticket application, there's no problem, the signal is fine",0,unhappy
Plus app testing. This app has so much bugs! Force close every time. Booked a flight than the app was closed saying it was not responding. Will give 4 stars if you improve. And where on earth the member login page?,0,unhappy
"When I first downloaded it, this app worked fine and normal....bank transfers, credit cards, internet banking also worked fine and coupons also worked...However, the more here this app is, instead of getting better, it's getting worse....Internet banking payment channel it doesn't appear...Even if you pay using a credit card it often fails...Bank Transfers sometimes appear sometimes it doesn't appear...Especially now that Air Asia is not on the search list...but I admit that the price is indeed the cheapest compared to other apps ...So please fix the system at Pegipegi immediately...Cook more and more people know about Pegipegi but the service is decreasing....Because I am a loyal customer of Pegipegi....Also a suggestion to add flights for Garuda Indonesia",0,unhappy
"according to the information in the application, rooms are available but cannot be booked",0,unhappy
Applications often force close while in use,0,unhappy
"If you want to continue with the booking process, it always suddenly fails and the application goes blank even though you've tried it many times",0,unhappy
"Booking airline tickets is really difficult, it keeps failing... after entering the CC details suddenly there is an email the order has been cancelled. Re-order again, the discount coupon can't be used anymore. And still failed. Please fix.",0,unhappy
Still having trouble redeeming the code. There is no login for members yet. UI is quite comfortable.,0,unhappy
"For hotel bookings smoothly, but bookings often fail to order airline tickets due to system failure. The appearance of the application is decent and smooth. However, it is necessary to add a login menu for registered users.",0,unhappy
"1) Haven't been able to get a booking for several airlines such as Garuda, Trigana; 2) If you frequently check flights, there are no available flights. After the app is restarted, new ones appear; 3) There is no history of the names of passengers who have been ordered before; 4) Flight info is not up to date; 5) If you order Batik connecting Lion, the Batik Air logo is listed on Lion (JT) flights so that passengers think it's a Batik flight even though it's Lion; 6) The process of updating the flight is very long / not finished",0,unhappy
It's very difficult to book via the app because bookings often fail ðŸ˜“,0,unhappy
"Finally, there is an application. Unfortunately there is no login feature. There is also no Garuda airline.",0,unhappy
How come? He said with the book via the android app a discount of 200 thousand and valid until August 31 but how come it's only 150 thousand duh this is called playing with consumers huhuu,0,unhappy

"The app has very bad system. I already booked and paid a 4 star hotel room. And we got a call around MIDNIGHT before check-in day, saying that the hotel was full and we were given two choices, to refund or book other hotels from their list,which were wayyy lower grade than the previous hotel!! And this happened TWICE. I tell you guys, NEVER use this app on peak season!",0,unhappy
"This app has the best in terms of price, but in terms of service, it really is disappointing. It said that you can cancel the bookings, but they didn't mention clearly about the administration fee, and the refund that would take time for 30-45 days! On other apps, I just have to hit cancel button, no admin fee, no charges on my billing in the first place.",0,unhappy
"Bad app, need rescheduled but given the same price as new ticket. I dont know whats wrong, the system or the CS ( Back-office)",0,unhappy
"non stop spamming u with push notifications without the option to turn it off. zero privacy policy and definitely not at its best version yet. invoice received was poorly made, you can't change your email either even if ure stuck w facebook login from d beginning. everything's lacking.",0,unhappy
"I ordered tickets for 11 people, payment has been received but there is a problem with the booking process to the airline because the maximum provision is only 9 people. Why is there no handle from the system for this problem? There should be a mechanism to prevent this from happening before the user makes an order and payment. This app is very bad and looks very unprofessional.",0,unhappy
"Worst travel ecommerce system in Indonesia ! if the hotel room only have 1 room left , and there are 10 people book at the same time, all of them still can pay the booking within 1-2 hours and Pegipegi only choose 1 to book, and they just cancel the other booking with no solution, and easily said they will refund in 7-14 days without have any concern to the customer..",0,unhappy
I was booking the plane ticket from Pegipegi because it had good price at beginning but the price has changed so sudden. They maybe offer the seats which actually have already been booked or these good prices are just a label to attract the customer? and I couldn't fill the passenger data neither press the payment option,0,unhappy
"very very bad app system, the application didn't update their price before selling for customer, they canceled my order and They ask a refund for 3 days not like other app. They didn't care that we had to buy ticket again... already ask CS but they give unsolved and bad solution,. never use this application anymore ... disappointed!..",0,unhappy
The app is not available during promotion period which gives discount while buying stuff through the app. The promotion lasts only for about 2 hours and the server is always under maintenance during this period. Scam app dont download. Good job pegipegi. Keep up the good work :),0,unhappy
"Couldn't book flight ticket if you don't have Indonesia ID Card (KTP). I am an Indonesian and my partner is British. It's impossible to book any flight ticket for him coz the page only allow the KTP (Indo ID Card) number, won't accept passport number.. and without this KTP number filled, it won't able to makes any booking..",0,unhappy
"worst travel agent ever!! . please be careful, when you see ""free cancelation"" when you order, it will be different when already become hotel voucher printed ""there will be penalty when you canceled depending hotel policy"". if they said they will call you 1x24 hours, it's a lie. nobody will call you.",0,unhappy
"They said the promo was at 11 o'clock. I waited for it, but at 11 o'clock, the application couldn't load, server maintenance. When I checked, the remaining coupons were 0. (Even though it was only 11:00) Dirty and cunning business strategy. UNINSTALL immediately!!! English: It says promo. But the server always responded ""under maintenance"" during the promo duration. Moreover, it showed ""0 (zero) coupon left"" at the first minute the promo was being started. DIRTY & BAD business. MUST BE UNINSTALLED!!!",0,unhappy
"Very bad, it takes a long time to refund ticket. Service is very bad. Another application provide faster services. Better not installed it or register in it",0,unhappy
"Usually I never write a review of anything except for this useless app, I can't search anything, a hotel or flights in 2 days, it says THE HOTEL YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME, AN ERROR HAPPENED IN THE SYSTEM, PLEASE TRY AGAIN! Well i guess its time to uninstall this useless app, i think u guys should put effort or money in server and maintenance rather than commercial promotions! bye...",0,unhappy
"Bad !!! I updated the apps to new version but I always got validation error ""Terjadi Kesalahan Sistem"" . And in the menu Pesanan the system always display error Terjadi Kesalahan SistemðŸ™„",0,unhappy
I am sorry tht i have to say this apps and all the cs must be upgraded! my flight was cancelled and the cs doesnt even check for me till i check for myself that my plane is actually switched .. all they i asked me to do is just REFUND without solution. This apps n cs is dissapointing.,0,unhappy
"Overall Okay for budget hotel, booked a hotel with good prices, but not for the services, not flexible, unable to create invoice under company name where there's also no guide how to book under company's, would give pegipegi 1 star for services, and will not make any reservation from this OTA anymore, thanks",0,unhappy
"Very easy to use. No confusing process. But in the middle of the process... Taraaaa.... ""Harga berubah menjadi..."". Then the ""real price"" emerge.",0,unhappy
Online check-in is not functional at all. It keeps saying there's no internet connection when the phone is fully connected.,0,unhappy
"The prices are still high. There is no AirAsia and others, mostly only Lion Group. Too bad. It works only for domestic and it doesn't work for International student flights. Sorry Uninstall",0,unhappy

Nice price for Staycation,1,satisfied
"Simple UI and easy to navigate. Within less than 5 clicks, you will reach the payment page. Would recommend people to try it out.",1,satisfied
"1. This application is really really nice, with competitive ticket prices. I think this application is good and light, but it still has less value, which is that it still offers seats on flights that are actually fully booked. This is troublesome. We hope that ""pegipegi"" will immediately make improvements so that they don't offer flights that are already full. 2. One weakness....at the time we need to order other options, such as I want to go by plane but return by train, than we should order one by one. wasting time",1,satisfied

"Is very helpful as we are in travelling. Especially as we need a hotel's room to stay, when we arrives in one town. It doesn't need to search our hotel's room for overnight by visiting the hotel one by one.

Now I'm starting to use it again because without a promo code the price is usually cheaper, although not much. So you don't have to bother looking for a promo code. It's just that it will be better if when you check out you immediately have a choice which promo code to use.",1,satisfied
